Plugin to create a chart that shows the number of posts and comments for the hours of a day and/or the days of a week.

== Description ==

With this WordPress plugin a chart is generated to show the number of posts and comments for the hours of a day or for the days of a week.

== Installation ==

To install the plugin just extract the zip file and copy the subfolder "pocoti" to your plugins directory. Set write permissions for the server for this directory. Activate the plugin and go to the options panel, where you can set different options (colors, titles, size). To show the graph just include an image referencing the chart URL (given on the options page). You can include the chart into blog entries or into template files. The files are generated when a new post or comment ist made, so it is always up to date.

The graph is generated by the JpGraph Library, which is for non-commercial use only!

To use JpGraph and so to use this plugin, your server needs to comply with the following requirements:

* PHP >= 4.3.1 and < 5.x
* GD Library >= 1.8 (with FreeType support), see your phpinfo()...

! The plugin does not work with PHP 5 yet, I will release a special version for PHP 5 later!

== Configuration ==

The configuration options are simple and do not need explanation. See the administration panel of the plugin in your WP admin frontend.
